                <h1>Sobre</h1>
                <img class="fotos" alt="minha foto" src="imagens/lucasfavaro.jpg"/>
                <p> My name is Lucas Gabriel Alves Favaro, I'm 18 years old, I was born in the city of Jales,
                    but I moved to Marinópolis as a child, where I live for more than 14 years,
                    a typical small and quiet city where everyone knows each other.
                    Where I did all my school life, from elementary school to high school.</p>

                <p>Even in all these years I never wanted and did not have the opportunity to do some technical course,
                    which I regret a lot. By the end of high school I had not yet decided what a faculty to do, with that I 
                    ended up doing nothing in the first half of that year.
                    Who gave me the idea of ​​doing Fatec was my sister who had already done Agronomy,
                    I registered for the entrance exam and I was able to pass and today I am
                    attending my first semester of Internet Systems.   </p>

                <p> I was interested in doing this course because I really like the area of
                    TI and to be honest the only one that was nocturnal that pleased me,
                     I also wanted to specialize more in the area as it was
                    my best option was what I chose, besides being a profession
                    which is growing more and more. </p>

                <p>Like many young people my age I like games,
                    among the various genres that exist my favorites are those of
                    campaign mode or story mode, first person FPS games
                    and survival games most of them in multiplayer mode,
                    which is the biggest trend of "gamers" in the virtual world.</p>
